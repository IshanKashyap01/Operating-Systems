# First Come First Serve (FCFS)

- It is the simplest scheduling algorithm
- According to FCFS, the first process to arrive in the ready queue is the first
one to sent for execution
- Naturally, if a high BT process comes before low BT ones, it will keep them in
waiting for a long time. This is called as **convoy effect** or **starvation**
