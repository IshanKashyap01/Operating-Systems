# Process Management

- A process is simply a program under execution
- It is a unit of work done by the computer
- A CPU can only run one process at a time
- OS creates processes and rapidly alternates b/w them to create an illusion of
multiple processes running simultaneously
- This process is known as **virtualization of CPU**
- The technique used for this is called **time sharing**

Thus, OS *abstracts* the **CPU** using the *mechanism* of **time sharing** to fulfill the
*policy* known as **Scheduling Policy**
