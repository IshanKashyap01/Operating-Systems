# Analogy

Imagine a restaurant w/o a manager. Here, shared resources among chefs like
utensils will not be used optimally as one chef may halt the progress of others.
There will be no one to check and ensure availability of raw materials as they
run out. Without a manager to ensure interoperability b/w chefs, waiters, cleaners
etc. they will have to do their jobs **and** ensure proper communication and sync
with their colleagues.

A manager will take this overhead from each and every employee so that they need
only do their own jobs and not focus on anything else.

## In this analogy

- Customers     : Users
- Waiters       : Application
- Manager       : OS
- Countertop    : RAM
- Cupboard      : Disk
- Chef          : CPU

## Conclusion

An OS acts as an interface b/w apps and h/w by ensuring proper allocation of
resources and encapsulating the complexities that apps may have to face in a lack
of an OS.

## Example

You must have interacted with an OS when working on your laptop or mobile like
Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS etc. Think of a common scenario of copying and
pasting the contents of one file to another. Do you think OS play a role in this?
If yes, explain how.

When we are copying the contents of one file to another, then we are writing on a
storage disk. OS takes care of this, as you must have observed that copying and
pasting works on your new PC, even before you have installed any new apps. This
is because the OS provides this support to us.
