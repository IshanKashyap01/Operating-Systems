# Components of Operating System

There are two components of operating system:

## Kernel

- It is the core of the OS, where all the OS specific tasks are taken care of
- It is the first application to execute after startup
- It is not directly accessible to the user
- Only this component of OS has privilege to the hardware
- It grants controlled access of h/w to the users and applications

### Components of Kernel

- Process manager
- Memory manager
- File manager
- I/O manager

## User space

- This is where all the user-related applications are run
- All the applications in user space interacts with the kernel to talk to the h/w
- There are four components of user space viz. GUI, CLI, system s/w and user apps
