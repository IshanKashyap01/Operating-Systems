# Introduction to Operating Systems

Operating System is a system software that has privilege access to hardware and
uses it to act as a bridge between software and hardware.

## Functions of OS

- Interface b/w apps and h/w
- Resource management
- Encapsulates h/w complexity
- Isolation and protection of apps

## Functionalities of OS

Operating systems have two main functionalities:

- Hiding complexity : Abstraction
- Managing resources: Arbitration

When the OS is say, letting you use a peripheral device such as speakers/scanners,
it is abstracting and when we are, for instance running multiple applications,
it is arbitrating.

### Abstraction

This refers to the ability of an OS to hide complex mechanisms behind the working
of hardware from both users and applications.

### Arbitration

This refers to the ability of an OS to manage the hardware resources of a computer
system.
