# Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQ Scheduling)

- This is an advanced version of the MLQ scheduling algorithm

- In this case, a process can move from one queue to another for optimisation

- There will be time quantums for each queues, that increases as the queue's
priority decreases

- If the process does not complete in the current queue, it will be moved to the
next queue where it will get more time to as the queue
