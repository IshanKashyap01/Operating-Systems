# Solid State Drives (SSDs)

- Unlike magnetic disks, SSDs do not use any mechanical parts to operate

- It uses a **NAND based flash memory** making it generally *10X faster* than *HDDs*

## Data Organization

- The smallest unit of an *SSD* is called a **page** of size **4 KB** not to be
confused with the memory pages in RAM

- Data is written in terms of **blocks**, which are a combination of several pages

- Generally, a *block* contains *128 pages*, meaning, they are usually *512 KB*
in size
