# Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)

- HDDs are a type of *magnetic drive* as it uses magnetism to operate on data

- It contains rotating disks known as **platter** on which, the data is stored

- These *platters* are placed in a stack attached to a **spindle** in their middle

- The spindle rotates at very high speeds ranging from **5400 RPM to 7200 RPM**

- A **mechanical arm** with a **read-write head** is placed on the *platter*

- All the *arms* are connected to pillar known as **arm assembly** and move *across*
the *platters* to read and write data

## Data Organization in HDDs

- A disk is divided in terms of **tracks**, **sectors**, **blocks** and **cylinders**

- A **track** is a circular section of a *platter*, which is further divided into
**sectors**, where the data is stored

- A set of *tracks* on one arm location is known as **cylinder**

- A group of *sectors* is known as a **block**

- Time taken for the *read-write head* to move from one sector to another is known
as **seek time**
