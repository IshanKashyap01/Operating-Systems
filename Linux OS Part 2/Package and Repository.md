# Package and Repository Management

- **apt-cache** searching a package on an Ubuntu system (Debiandistribution)
- **apt-get** is a command line interface for installing packages
- **apt-get install** to install any package
- **apt-get remove** to remove a package
- **apt-get update** will refresh the repositories
- **apt-get upgrade** will upgrade all the packages

- Linux can install these packages without using a browser because it has a *repository*
with location to the installation files

- These repositories can be *http, ftp, file based or even a local path*
